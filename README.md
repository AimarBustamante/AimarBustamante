# Hi 👋🏻, I'm Aimar Bustamante
A passionate frontend developer from Panama 🇵🇦

## 🚀 About Me
I was born on November 15, 2004 in Panama City. Since I was a kid I've always been interested in technology and everything behind it. I started programming with Python but when I started learning HTML, I decided study web development.

I love learn, I'm completely self-taught and I owe most of my knowledge to YouTube and the wonderful community of developers around the world.
